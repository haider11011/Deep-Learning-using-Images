# Deep-Learning-using-Images

This repository contains a comprehensive computer vision project divided into three main parts:
1. Image Techniques and Filtering
2. Image Retrieval
3. Image Classification and Transfer Learning


## Overview

This project demonstrates various computer vision techniques through three modules:
- **Image Techniques and Filtering**: Basic image processing techniques such as blurring, edge detection, and morphological operations.
- **Image Retrieval**: Techniques for retrieving similar images from a dataset based on visual content.
- **Image Classification and Transfer Learning**: Classification of images using deep learning models and transfer learning.

## Usage

To run the code, navigate to the respective directories and try running the Jupyter notebooks. It is recommended to create a conda environment and install the required dependencies.
